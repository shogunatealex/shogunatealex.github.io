## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

#Steps towards Optimization:

1. CSS
* The style sheet was small so I moved all of it into the HTML document. This wouldn't be preferred if it was much longer but for such a simple site there is not need to make a request to another style sheet
* Created a media query so that print.css is only called if the media type is print.
* Removed the call to the google font, instead opted to download the font and link to it locally. That saves a trip to the google server while still maintaing the font.
* Removed unnecessary CSS rules. There were a couple that I could find and consolidate.

2. JS
* Minified the perfmatters.js script.
* made the google analytics script run asynchronously

3. *Images
* Optimized all the images using Photoshop save for web feature.
* Reduced the size of the pizzeria from 2K to 720P, then created a thumbnail that was even smaller for the main page.
* Downloaded the pictures locally so that they wouldn't need to call a server every time. This reduced the CRP.



#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
